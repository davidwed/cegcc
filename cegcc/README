CeGCC - cross-development tools for Windows CE (PocketPC).

The CeGCC project aims to provide a consistent and working set of development
tools that generate code for Windows CE devices such as PDA's and smart phones.
Our intended development platforms are GNU/Linux and Cygwin.

This project is free software. See the files COPYING and COPYING.LIB for
the GPL and LGPL licenses that cover much - but not all! - of this software.

More information can be found in the docs subdirectory of the distribution,
