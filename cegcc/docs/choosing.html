<h2>A Unix-like application</h2>
<p>
<h2>Use only the Windows CE API</h2>
<p>
<h2>Choosing in which environment to develop</h2>
<p>
<h2>Microsoft environment equivalents</h2>
<p>
The Microsoft compilers offer several so-called subsystems,
and some choices are made by the compiler based on the application sources offered to it.
The CeGCC compiler doesn't offer all of that behaviour,
as we outline below.
<p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Microsoft subsystem</td>
		<td>short decsription</td>
		<td>CeGCC equivalent ?</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>CONSOLE</td>
		<td>character-mode applications</td>
		<td>not offered (currently, the Voxware tools had something in this area).
			It is possible to create applications without a console
			but also without windows (applications that just manipulate files)
			though.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>WINDOWS, WINDOWSCE</td>
		<td>applications that create their own windows</td>
		<td>this is the standard behaviour for the arm-wince-mingw32ce tools</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>NATIVE</td>
		<td>this applies to device drivers</td>
		<td>not offered</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>POSIX</td>
		<td>unix-like applications</td>
		<td>this is the standard behaviour for the arm-wince-cegcc tools</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>
<font color="red">Important</font> : the above is interpretation.
You may be inclined to believe that it is more recommended to use the arm-wince-mingw32ce tools,
or the other way around.
We offer both sets of tools, neither is believed to be superior to the other.
They both have their uses.
<p>
The Microsoft tools have some default behaviour,
such as <i>if main is defined then CONSOLE is the default</i>.
CeGCC doesn't mimic that behaviour.
<p>
The <b>/ENTRY</b> option to the Microsoft compiler is equivalent to CeGCC's <b>-e</b> option.
