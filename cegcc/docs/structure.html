This document describes the structure of the CeGCC directory tree
and of the CeGCC modules.
By <i>modules</i> we mean the different softwares or their components,
which we assemble to create CeGCC.
<P>
<H1>Directory structure - src/</H1>
<H2>src/mingw</H2>
This directory's primary purpose is to hold the necessary startup code 
and needed static code
to be able to use coredll.dll as only runtime.
You can consider src/mingw a gcc replacement for corelibc.lib
in other development tools.
Added to that, there are some other goodies.
<H3>src/mingw/mingwex</H3>
Mingwex are the MinGW added extensions to add support for C99 and some POSIX functionality not found in MSVCRT.
See <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/mingwex">http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/mingwex</A>
Please don't just add stubs there.
Those are more harmful that good,
because if you do, an app using autoconf's AC_CHECK_FUNC will find it,
and instead of providing a proper replacement, will call the stubbed 
one, which won't work obviously.
<H3>src/mingw/profile</H3>
<H3>src/mingw/wince</H3>
Then there is the new mingw/wince dir, where one place wince code that 
doesn't fit in the other dirs, because
the desktop versions of mingw doesn't need it. Keep in mind, that the 
less we diverge from the upstream versions,
the easiest we can pull from updates they have.
<H3>src/mingw/include</H3>
The headers in mingw/include correspond to the std c part of coredll.dll
(stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc, etc.).
This contrasts with src/w32api/include which holds headers corresponding to
win32 api definitions, there is no std c runtime stuff there.
The arm-wince-mingw32ce toolset uses only the Windows CE DLLs,
the arm-wince-cegcc uses newlib, so it uses the corresponding newlib headers.
You can't (shouldn't) mix headers from newlib, and from mingw/include.
<P>
Take a look, there are headers with the same name, 
for instance, there is a stdio.h in newlib,
and a stdio.h too in mingw/include, but they are incompatible. Usually 
the headers from newlib are more complete, but
so is the c runtime support in newlib. The danger in mixing the two sets 
is in that some (many/most) constants
and structures are completely different in the two.
<P>
Take for instance the stdio functions. The FILE struct (think fprintf, 
fwrite, etc) is totally incompatible in the two. Sure, struct FILE
is (mostly) an opaque structure, but there are cases where an inline 
function accesses its members directly. Take stdout for instance,
in newlib, it maps to something like '_impure_ptr->_stdout' (from heart, 
so the names may be wrong), while in
mingw/include (mingw32ce), it maps to '_getstdfilex(1)'.
<P>
Now imagine a cegcc app, calling newlib's version of fprintf like so:
<PRE>
fprintf (stdout, "Look ma, I can crash!\n");
</PRE>
which after preprocessing, maps to:
<PRE>
fprintf (_getstdfilex(1), "Look ma, I can crash!\n");
</PRE>
If that doesn't crash, it will be pure luck.
<H3>src/w32api/include</H3>
This holds headers corresponding to
win32 api definitions, there is no std c runtime stuff there.
<H2>src/newlib</H2>
Newlib is a portable C library implementation.
We're using it to augment the arm-wince-cegcc toolset with a UNIX-like environment.
<H3>src/newlib/newlib/libc/sys/wince</H3>
Our implementation of newlib is itself augmented with some Windows CE specific stuff.
The idea is to document this stuff in
<A HREF="layer.html">the unix-like layer provided by CeGCC</A>.
<H1>Comparison to other libraries and modules</H1>
<H2>MSVCRT</H2>
<P>
This might be the Microsoft Visual C RunTime library.
MSDN describes msvcrt.dll
<A HREF="http://search.msdn.microsoft.com/search/Redirect.aspx?title=C+Run-Time+Libraries+(CRT)+&url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/abx4dbyh(VS.80).aspx">here</A>
as a multi-threaded dynamic link library (aka DLL).
In <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vclib/html/_crt_c_run.2d.time_libraries.asp">this page</A>
it is further described as a system library that is intended for use by Windows itself,
but that you're allowed to use in applications.
<P>
This is not something we have on Windows CE.
<P>
A source of confusion might be that there are MSVCRT replacement libraries in MingW,
which you might be tempted to port.
These are incompatible with the two other sets of libraries that we do use,
COREDLL (Windows CE's standard library),
and newlib (a more unix-like library).
