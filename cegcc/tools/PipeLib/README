		   README for PipeLib

This directory contains the PipeLib enhancer for Windows CE.

PipeLib implements a stream driver that is exposed in an interface
similar to unnamed pipes on desktop Windows.  Namelly, pipes are
created with CreatePipe and the pipe ends are manipulated with the normal
ReadFileW/WriteFileW/CloseHandle coredll.dll functions.

To build the lib and the driver you will need the arm-mingw32ce
toolchain.  An early version of PipeLib was also tested with MSVC2005,
but project files aren't presently included.

To build, ensure you have arm-mingw32ce-gcc in your $PATH, and
type:

make

If you have synce-tools installed, type:

make download

The previous command will copy the driver (PipeDev.dll) to \Windows on
the device.

If you don't have synce-tools installed, then copy the newly built
PipeDev.dll file into the \Windows on the device.

PipeLib comes with a sample tester, but the main testbed client is
currently the rshd server for Windows CE found at
http://cegcc.sourceforge.net.  Both PipeLib and rshd share the same
repository, so be sure you have a checkout from the same date before
reporting bugs.

Have fun!
