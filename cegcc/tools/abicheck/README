A simple ABI checker.  It isn't very smart, or automatic, but
serves the immediate purpose.

The idea is to have gcc built code interfacing with MSVC
built code, and ensuring the the arguments are passed
correctly to both sides.

msvc.obj is built with MSVC.  Since access to a MSVC is limited,
the object file is kept in the repository.

To build, type `make'.  If you're changing the msvc.cpp file, be sure
to have access to an MSVC that can output ARM WinCE code, and type
`make all-msvc'.
