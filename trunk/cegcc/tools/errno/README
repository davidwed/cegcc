This is an errno <-> {Get|Set}LastError mapper.

<describe here the technique used>

Do *not* install errno.h into
/opt/mingw32ce/arm-mingw32ce/include.

You have been warned.

This is only used as a porting aid.  Ideally you use this as an
interim measure until you finish the port.  If you chose to keep using
it, and you are writing a lib to be reused by others, be sure to *NOT*
export any header that includes errno.h.  Do *NOT* expect your users
to have errno.h.  If needed, copy errno.h and errno.c into your
project, but again, do *NOT* force it into the users.

Have fun!
