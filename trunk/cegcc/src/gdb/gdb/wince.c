/******************** Beginning of stub interface ********************/

/* Stub interface description:

   The Windows CE stub implements a crude RPC.  The hand-held device
   connects to gdb using port 7000.  gdb and the stub then communicate
   using packets where:

   byte 0:              command id (e.g. Create Process)

   byte 1-4:    DWORD

   byte 1-2:    WORD

   byte 1-2:    length
   byte 3-n:    arbitrary memory.

   The interface is deterministic, i.e., if the stub expects a DWORD
   then the gdb server should send a DWORD.
 */

/* Note: In the functions below, the `huh' parameter is a string
   passed from the function containing a descriptive string concerning
   the current operation.  This is used for error reporting.

   The 'what' parameter is a command id as found in wince-stub.h.
