<H1>CeGCC License</H1>
<p>
The licensing of free software products is not an easy issue.
Aggregated products like cegcc are even more complicated to describe accurately.
<p>
To understand all this, you'll need to know about the different types of material involved,
and about the way their licenses work.
The collection of all that is the CeGCC licensing.
<p>
I see three types of material :
<ul>
	<li>software that is used to develop, but that doesn't itself get distributed with the application being developed
	<li>software that ends up in the application being developed
	<li>documentation
</ul>
<p>
CeGCC is an aggregation of several free software products,
and you'll see that they come with different licenses.
A well known license is the GNU Public License (also known as GPL),
it is often described as <i>viral</i>,
meaning that it tends to infect software.
<p>
It is important to understand that only the software in the first bullet above
carries such licenses.
Because of the fact that this software never ends up in the application being developed,
the viral aspect doesn't apply.
<p>
The only other thing you basically need to know is that the licenses for each original piece
of software from which cegcc is aggregated still apply.
All the software added specifically by the cegcc project authors carries the most liberal
license we can apply; see the source files themselves.
<p>
If this all looks very confusing,
maybe we can convince you by showing that projects like
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gcc">gcc</a>
also follow this approach.
Here is an example from the GCC documentation :
<pre>
The GNU Compiler Collection is free software. See the file COPYING for
copying permission. The manuals, and some of the runtime libraries, are
under different terms; see the individual source files for details.
