<P>
CeGCC ships with three DLL files.
You can find them at
<PRE>
/usr/ppc/arm-wince-pe/lib/device/cegcc.dll
/usr/ppc/arm-wince-pe/lib/device/cegccthrd.dll
/usr/ppc/arm-wince-pe/lib/device/libstdc++.dll
</PRE>
<P>
The good thing about those DLLs is they allow you to create
smaller and more efficient applications.
<b>DLLs are a good thing</b>, let's be clear about that !
They do have a downside, however.
<P>
If you try to run an application that requires a DLL
and that DLL isn't available, then Windows CE will simply tell you
that this application or a part of it was not found.
No reference to which DLL you're missing.
<P>
The DLLs which we ship in <i>/usr/ppc/arm-wince-pe/lib/device</i>
are stripped version, meant to be installed on your PDA.
In the directory above, files of the same name (but bigger) exist.
They are unstripped versions (they still contain named symbol definitions),
which you don't need on your PDA.
<P>
Depending on the tools available to you,
you will want to run commands such as
<PRE>
pcp /usr/ppc/arm-wince-pe/lib/device/cegcc.dll /windows/cegcc.dll
pcp /usr/ppc/arm-wince-pe/lib/device/cegccthrd.dll /windows/cegccthrd.dll
pcp /usr/ppc/arm-wince-pe/lib/device/libstdc++.dll /windows/libstdc++.dll
