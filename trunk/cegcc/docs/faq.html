If you use PC Windows (x86/x64), you may need to use the
    &quot;standard&quot; native tool provided by the system.
    WE WILL ALWAYS REFERENCE TO IT AS TO THE 
    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activesync">ActiveSync</A>
    (USB, Infrared, Serial, Bluetooth, WiFi/LAN/Dial-up TCP/IP - support depends on the version),
    while in fact ...
    <UL>
<LI>
    On Windows XP SP2 and earlier, you need the &quot;real&quot;
    <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activesync">ActiveSync</A>.
    If you want to connect to a WinCE 6.0 based device, you will definitely need the 
    <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/activesync/default.mspx">ActiveSync 4.5, or newer</A>
    (WinCE 3.0 and newer supported).
    On the other hand, starting with this release, Microsoft Office
    Outlook 2000 is no longer supported (you need Outlook 2003 or newer).
    Hence, if your device is WinCE 5.0 based, you can use the 
    <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7269173a-28bf-4cac-a682-58d3233efb4c&DisplayLang=en">ActiveSync 4.2</A>
    (WinCE 3.0 and newer supported, see also
    <A HREF="http://www.hpcfactor.com/qlink/?linkID=8#Download">here</A>).
    For yet older WinCE based devices, try the 
    <A HREF="http://www.hpcfactor.com/qlink/?linkID=7#Download">ActiveSync 3.8</A>
    (from WinCE 2.0 to WinCE 4.2.1, maybe also WinCE 5.0).
    <BR>Getting this really big s..t working may often be very, if not
    &quot;extremely&quot;, difficult.
    The best idea, which solves all these problems (and many, many, many more), is
    to delete PC Windows and install <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</A>.

<UL>
<LI>
It runs code compiled for ARM processors. In most cases, you can run the same binaries on the emulator as you do on the device.
</LI>
<LI>
You can connect a runnning Device Emulator to a directory on your PC as if the directory were a drive mounted on the Device Emulator. In the file system for the Device Emulator, the connected directory appears at the root level as Storage Card (you can connect the Device Emulator to only one directory, with all its subdirectories, at a time).
</LI>
<LI>
It supports synchronizing with 
<A HREF="#FileTransfer">ActiveSync</A>.
This feature allows you to debug applications that are syncing, or be able to use real synchronized data from within the Device Emulator.
Use the Device Emulator Manager (DEM) to start, connect to, and manage Device Emulator instances on your PC. Using the DEM menu commands, you can connect to the emulator, cradle and uncradle it, shut it down, reset it, bring it to the front, clear saved states, refresh images, and perform other tasks.
When a device is cradled, it can communicate using <A HREF="#FileTransfer">ActiveSync</A> (synchronizing contents of email, calendar, application installations, and so on). The Device Emulator by itself has no equivalent functionality and cannot work with <A HREF="#FileTransfer">ActiveSync</A> unless it is cradled. A common scenario is to launch the Device Emulator, cradle it using the DEM, and then establish an <A HREF="#FileTransfer">ActiveSync</A> (set &quot;File -> Connection Settings... -> Allow connections to one of the following: DMA&quot;) partnership with it.

In order to use it, you just need to:

The installation will create shortcuts on your start menu from where you can launch the various configurations of the Windows Mobile 5.0/6 MSFP (ARM CPU). You will also see a shortcut for the Device Emulator Manager (DEM) using which you can launch any of the installed images.

      The error &quot;No line number known for MyProcedure&quot; means that the debugging symbols are not present in your binary DLL/EXE. It seems, you&#39;ve forgotten to use the &quot;-g&quot; compiler flag (when compiling your source code).

      The errors &quot;(no debugging symbols found)&quot; and &quot;No symbol table is loaded.

      The best idea is to recompile your source code (with &quot;-g&quot; and without &quot;-s&quot; compiler flags), and then try to debug it once again.

      <P>
      You get this error message because, the debugger tries to &quot;list&quot; the source code for the &quot;program entry point routine&quot;, which it apparently cannot locate in your source code.
      <BR>Most probably, you&#39;re trying to debug an application which is a WinCE GUI (Graphical User Interface) application.
      The normal user&#39;s startup routine for such an application is called &quot;WinMain&quot;.
      However, the &quot;standard&quot; entry point, for C/C++ language programs, is the &quot;main&quot;.
      So, CeGCC implements a special glue module which automatically defines the &quot;main&quot; function for you, which then calls your &quot;WinMain&quot; routine.
      <BR>The solution is simple, just ask the debugger to &quot;list WinMain&quot;, and you should immediately see your source code, unless you have forgotten to <A HREF="#GdbStippedExe">provide the debugging symbols</A>.
      <BR>Note also that, when you compile a program that has the &quot;main&quot; routine of its own, then the automatic CeGCC &quot;main&quot; module is simply not used. In this case, you should never get such an error message, unless you have forgotten to <A HREF="#GdbStippedExe">provide the debugging symbols</A> (try to &quot;list main&quot;), of course.

      Why is my &quot;arm-wince-mingw32ce-g++&quot; compiled DLL/EXE so large?
      </A></STRONG><BR>
      <P>
      First, let me explain, why I am taking about the &quot;arm-wince-mingw32ce-g++&quot; compiler only, and not about the &quot;arm-wince-cegcc-g++&quot;.
      The reason is simple. The &quot;arm-wince-mingw32ce&quot; target ALWAYS STATICALLY LINKS the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_standard_library">stdc++ library</A>
into your every DLL/EXE binary.
      This may cause some really LARGE PARTS of this library to be INCLUDED in EACH of your DLL/EXE. You aks why? So do I! Apparently, it is the conseqence of the fact that, this target comes from the <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</A> project, and 
<A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/mingwfaq.shtml#faq-cpp-size">
that&#39;s how they do it</A>.
      The &quot;arm-wince-cegcc&quot; target, on the other hand, uses DYNAMICALLY LINKED 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_standard_library">stdc++ library</A>,
by default (of course,
<A HREF="dll.html">Beware! need to install CeGCC DLL&#39;s first</A>).

      <BR>So, let us now try to get the lowest possible size of your &quot;arm-wince-mingw32ce-g++&quot; compiled binaries. Let us create a very dumb &quot;MyProgram.cpp&quot;, which contains just &quot;int main(void) { return 0; }&quot;.
<UL>

  <LI>

If you do not need to debug your DLL/EXE any more, get rid of all symbol table and relocation information from it. Either <A HREF="#GdbStippedExe">remove them using &quot;arm-wince-[cegcc/mingw32ce]-strip MyProgram.[dll/exe]&quot;, or recompile your source code WITHOUT the &quot;-g&quot; and WITH the &quot;-s&quot; compiler flags</A>.
<BR>The example &quot;MyProgram.cpp&quot; compiled WITH &quot;-g&quot; is 203 kB long (for &quot;arm-wince-cegcc-g++&quot; it is just 18 kB long), but stripped, it is just 40 kB long (for &quot;arm-wince-cegcc-g++&quot;, it is just 3 kB long, when stripped).

  </LI>

  <LI>

If you do not need the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling">exception handling</A>
(i.e. 
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/exceptions.html">try/catch/throw</A>&quot;)
in your source code, compile it adding the &quot;-fno-exceptions&quot; compiler flag.
The <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling">exception handling</A>
generates extra code needed to propagate exceptions, which then triggers some 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_standard_library">stdc++ library</A>
(&quot;/opt/mingw32ce/arm-wince-mingw32ce/lib/libstdc++.a&quot;) functions

to be statically linked into your DLL/EXE.

<BR>Note that, if you do not specify this option, GNU CC will enable
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling">exception handling</A>
by default for languages like C++ which normally require it,
and disable it for languages like C that do not
normally require it.  However, you may need to enable this option
when compiling C code (adding the &quot;-fexceptions&quot; compiler flag)
that needs to interoperate properly with exception handlers written in C++.
<BR>The example &quot;MyProgram.cpp&quot; compiled WITH &quot;-fexceptions&quot; (the default), and stripped, is 40 kB long, but compiled WITH &quot;-fno-exceptions&quot;, and stripped, is just 4.5 kB long (for &quot;arm-wince-cegcc-g++&quot;, it doesn&#39;t really matter, it&#39;s always about 3 kB long, when stripped).

  <LI>

Avoid using any 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">Standard Template Library</A>
elements, especially in your DLL libraries, no matter what the cost!
C++ programs (and shared libraries) using the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">Standard Template Library</A>
(e.g. which &quot;#include &lt;iostream&gt;&quot; or any close &quot;relative&quot;) cause a really large part of the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_standard_library">stdc++ library</A>
(&quot;/opt/mingw32ce/arm-wince-mingw32ce/lib/libstdc++.a&quot;) to be statically linked into the binary.
<BR>If the only functions from &quot;libstdc++.a&quot; which you need are language support functions (those listed in 
<A HREF="http://www.zib.de/benger/C++/clause18.html">the Clause 18 of the C++ Standard</A>,
e.g. &quot;new&quot; and &quot;delete&quot;), then try linking against &quot;libsupc++.a&quot; (using gcc instead of g++ and explicitly linking in &quot;-lsupc++&quot; for the final link step should do it). This library contains only those support routines, one per object file. But if you are using anything from the rest of the library, such as &quot;IOStreams&quot; or &quot;Vectors&quot;, then you&#39;ll still need pieces from &quot;libstdc++.a&quot;.
<BR>Let us now extend the &quot;MyProgram.cpp&quot; example. Let us add a line in form &quot;#include &lt;iostream&gt;&quot;, before our &quot;main&quot; routine (we will NOT use any &quot;IOStreams&quot;, it is sufficient to just include this file). The extended example &quot;MyProgram.cpp&quot; compiled WITH &quot;-g&quot; is almost 4 MB long (for &quot;arm-wince-cegcc-g++&quot;, it is just 49 kB long). Stripped, it is still 544 kB long (for &quot;arm-wince-cegcc-g++&quot;, it is just 3.5 kB long, when stripped). The &quot;-fno-exceptions&quot; compiler flag has no impact on the size now (the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B_standard_library">stdc++ library</A>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling">exception handling</A>
code is always linked in anyhow, because it&#39;s used by the 
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Template_Library">Standard Template Library</A>
routines, I believe).

Last, but not least, you can, of course, use the above advices to minimize the size of your &quot;arm-wince-mingw32ce-gcc&quot; generated DLL/EXE binaries, too (i.e. when you compile any C source code, except for the

<BR>In general, because the
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Windows_versions">
Microsoft Windows System comes in so many flavours</A>,
there exist two mysterious suffixes, &quot;A&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, which may get appended to function names.
They directly correspond to the &quot;ASCII&quot; and the &quot;Wide-Character&quot; versions of the Windows API.
The system include files are meant to automatically map a function name into a function with
an added &quot;A&quot; or &quot;W&quot; to its name, depending on whether the &quot;UNICODE&quot; macro is defined, or not.
For WinCE, however, the &quot;UNICODE&quot; should always be defined, as WinCE supports only that part of the API.
Hence, there is no need to append the &quot;W&quot; suffix in this case (and it should not be present).
Our include files (&quot;/opt/mingw32ce/arm-wince-mingw32ce/include/*&quot;) are inherited from other projects (e.g. <A HREF="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</A>).
They&#39;re very good, but they tend to lack some WinCE specific stuff (well, WinCE is not their focus).
<BR>By running &quot;arm-wince-mingw32ce-strings&quot; on the right library file (&quot;/opt/mingw32ce/arm-wince-mingw32ce/lib/*.a&quot;), you can check whether the &quot;SomeWinCeFunction&quot; is present in there.
If it is not there, then
<A HREF="#MissingSymbols">we need to implement this function</A>.
If it is present, however, then it usually requires just some slight modifications of one of our include files
(you should then immediately be able to use this function, no further steps required).

The fix is to &quot;#ifdef&quot; the function&#39;s prototype, in the appropriate header file, with &quot;_WIN32_WCE&quot;,
so that this function is always declared as &quot;SomeWinCeFunction&quot;,
instead of the non-WinCE &quot;SomeWinCeFunctionA&quot; + &quot;SomeWinCeFunctionW&quot; pair
(which also depends on the &quot;UNICODE&quot; macro).
See, for example, any other function, which is present in the same header file as
&quot;SomeWinCeFunction&quot;, in order to learn what needs to be done.

   Get the free WinCE utility called 
   <A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=1571715">ROM Extractor</A>.
   This utility can &quot;extract&quot; DLL / EXE / CPL / ... modules from ROM (files
   which have the &quot;FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ROMMODULE&quot; set, i.e. files which cannot be copied by using a
   file manager nor by the 
   <A HREF="#FileTransfer">ActiveSync</A>).
    <A HREF="#FileTransfer">Copy</A> these &quot;extracted&quot; files into the PC

   &quot;Add Directory&quot; button in the &quot;Options -> Configure Module Search
   Order&quot; window (of the 
   <A HREF="http://dependencywalker.com/">Dependency Walker</A>
   ), in order to add this
   subdirectory to the &quot;Current Search Order&quot;.
   <BR>There are two things, I need to mention here. Although my CPU is an
   &quot;ARM&quot;, the &quot;extracted modules&quot; are marked as &quot;Thumb&quot;. This fools the
   <A HREF="http://dependencywalker.com/">Dependency Walker</A>
   a bit - it will mark all of them in red, to notify
   the user that the CPU types do not match. I do not know if this
   &quot;Thumb&quot; signature is really put in my ROM, or is it just the 
   <A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=1571715">ROM Extractor</A>
   which does it. The solution, however, is very simple. Just
   take any tool that can edit binary files (I use the free 
   <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_commander">
   GNU Midnight Commander</A>)
   and change one byte, or two, in each DLL (the bytes which define the
   CPU type). Very close to the beginning of the DLL file (usually inside of the first 256 bytes),
   you should find a sequence of bytes in form:
        &quot;0x50 0x45 0x00 0x00 0xC2 0x01&quot; (&quot;0x50 0x45&quot; = &quot;PE&quot;).
   The sequence &quot;0xC2 0x01&quot; means &quot;Thumb&quot; CPU, so we need to change it
   into &quot;0xC0 0x01&quot;, which means &quot;ARM&quot; CPU (just one, single byte to be changed):
        &quot;0x50 0x45 0x00 0x00 0xC0 0x01&quot;.
   The second thing to mention is related to the usage of the 
   <A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=1571715">ROM Extractor</A>.
   On my WinCE system, it keeps closing the &quot;Input Panel&quot;
   (i.e. the &quot;Keyboard&quot;), so that I cannot enter the &quot;Save to:&quot; output
   file. The solution is to manually open the &quot;Input Panel&quot; BEFORE
   starting the 
   <A HREF="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?p=1571715">ROM Extractor</A>
   executable (then the &quot;Keyboard&quot; remains available all the time).

<BR> There is still one thing, I need to mention here. As of today, Sun, Nov 11, 2007,
the <A HREF="http://dependencywalker.com/">Dependency Walker</A> has some problems
with binaries (DLL/EXE) generated by the CeGCC-0.50 release (and earlier, I believe).
The problem is related to the DLL names &quot;encoded&quot; inside of the CeGCC generated DLL/EXE files.
All these names miss the &quot;.dll&quot; file name extension. As a result, the
<A HREF="http://dependencywalker.com/">Dependency Walker</A> seeks for files
named &quot;DllName&quot; (which do NOT exist) instead of &quot;DllName.dll&quot; (which, hopefully, DO exist).
A temporary solution is to keep a copy of every &quot;DllName.dll&quot; file as a &quot;DllName&quot; file
(note, you do NOT need these copies on your WinCE device, just on the PC).

<BR>For the completeness of this description, let me add the following.

   which can be helpful (it checks which libraries are needed and it can
   &quot;rewrite&quot; both, the library name and it&#39;s version), but using it is a
   pain. Moreover, as this utility is NOT able to read system DLLs, it
   will not tell you which function is missing (if any), nor it will tell
   you which functions are provided by the system default DLLs.
   Note, this is really a &quot;command line&quot; driven utility. It NEEDS to get
   the name of the DLL/EXE file (to be &quot;inspected&quot;) in the command line
   (as a parameter). It will not start without this parameter.
