<p>
CeGCC is a cross-development environment for ARM-based systems (PDA's) running Windows CE.
This means you can create PocketPC applications
for handhelds that run Windows CE on an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM processor</a>.
We provide a cross-compiler, but also a cross-debugger.
<p>
This project is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>.
It bundles a number of other free software projects
into a consistent and working set of development tools.
The patches we need to apply to those other softwares are fed back to those projects
for inclusion in their sources.
<p>
Our target platforms are the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">cygwin</a> environment
and <a href="http://www.linux.org">GNU/Linux</a> systems.

<h1>Options</h1>
<p>
CeGCC gives you the choice to either develop
applications based exclusively on the Windows CE environment,
or to use a unix-like layer in addition to the Windows CE API,
which makes porting applications much easier.
<p>
This is described in more detail in
<a href="choosing.html">Choosing in which environment to develop</a>.
