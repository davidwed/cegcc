    <h1>Choosing in which environment to develop</h1>
    <p>
    Remember that <i>arm-wince-cegcc</i> implements a unix-like layer on top of Windows CE,
    and that <i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i> implements the native CE API.
    <p>
    <b>Our recommendation is to use the <i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i> toolset whenever possible</b>
    because the newlib-based unix-like layer that <i>arm-wince-cegcc</i> implements is
    incomplete (it's newlib, not glibc) and sometimes confusing and incompatible with coredll.
    <p>
    On the other hand, <i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i> offers more complete C++ DLL support.
    We will probably implement a C++ DLL for the <i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i> environment shortly.
    Until we do so, you can easily build it for yourself by using
    the <i>src/build-mingw32ce-dlls.sh</i> script.
      <h2>1. Porting a Unix-like application</h2>
    <p>
    <i>Arm-wince-cegcc</i> is a great tool to start porting your application to WinCE,
    as it offers a unix-like layer on top of the Windows CE API.
    <p>
    This doesn't come without risks though (it is very easy to mix up stdio API's
    from coredll and newlib, and they're incompatible).
    Also be aware that Windows CE has many Unicode based system calls,
    you'll have to make sure your application can deal with that.
      <h2>2. Porting an application that uses only the Windows CE API</h2>
    <p>
    It should be abundantly clear that the right tool for this job is the <i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i>
    toolset.
      <h2>3. Recompiling a CE application that was built with Embedded Visual C++</h2>
    <p>
    <p>If you want to build an existing Windows CE application that already 
    builds with eVC, then you probably think you're not porting an application.
    <p>
    The right tool to use is <i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i>,
    but you need to be aware that some of the C or C++ extensions supported by
    eVC aren't available in our toolset.
      <h2>4. Porting an application that was built with MicroSoft Visual C++</h2>
    <p>
    <p>An application that is built not with eVC but MSVC (MicroSoft Visual C++)
    is not typically a Windows CE but a Windows application.
    This may be an issue because Windows CE supports only a limited subset of
    the Windows API.
    <p>
    Once more, the right tool to use is <i>arm-wince-mingw32ce</i>.
    <h2>5. Microsoft environment equivalents</h2>
    <p>The <b>/ENTRY</b> option to the Microsoft compiler is equivalent to ld's <b>-e</b>
      option.</P>
    <h2>6. Console Applications</h2>
    <h>In the NT/9x target versions of Microsoft's tools, there is have some 
    default behaviour, such as
    <i>if main is defined then CONSOLE subsytem is the default</i>.
    <p>Windows CE applications don't have that functionality, as they must always specify the Windows CE subsystem: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk.aspx">
        http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk.aspx</a>
    <p>If you want to develop a console based application, take a look at Pocket 
      Console: <a href="http://www.symbolictools.de/public/pocketconsole/">http://www.symbolictools.de/public/pocketconsole/</a></p>
    <p>The default user entry point in mingw32ce is WinMain, but if you don't provide 
      one, a default one will be linked in that will call the standard int main (int 
      argc, char** argv) with argc and argv properly filled.</p>
