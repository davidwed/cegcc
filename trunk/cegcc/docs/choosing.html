    <h1>Choosing in which environment to develop</h1>
    <p>
      <h2>A Unix-like application</h2>
    <p>
      <h2>Use only the Windows CE API</h2>
    <p>
      <h2>Choosing in which environment to develop</h2>
    <p>
    <p>If you want to build an existing Windows CE application that already 
      builds with eVC or MSVC, or you want to develop a Windows CE application that 
      only depends on the Win32 API and the limited libc support coredll.dll (the 
      native runtime) offers, then what you want is mingw32ce.</p>
    <p>If you want to port an application that depends on a more complete c runtime, 
      the cegcc toolchain will be a better environment. Cegcc offers unified 
      file descriptors, (in-process only) signals, (TODO: to be completed).</p>
    <h2>Microsoft environment equivalents</h2>
    <p>The <b>/ENTRY</b> option to the Microsoft compiler is equivalent to ld's <b>-e</b>
      option.</P>
    <h2>Console Applications</h2>
    <h>In the NT/9x target versions of Microsoft's tools, there is have some 
      default behaviour, such as <i>if main is defined then CONSOLE subsytem is the 
        default</i>.
    <p>Windows CE applications don't have that functionality, as they must always specify the Windows CE subsystem: <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk.aspx">
        http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk.aspx</a>
    <p>If you want to develop a console based application, take a look at Pocket 
      Console: <a href="http://www.symbolictools.de/public/pocketconsole/">http://www.symbolictools.de/public/pocketconsole/</a></p>
    <p>The default user entry point in mingw32ce is WinMain, but if you don't provide 
      one, a default one will be linked in that will call the standard int main (int 
      argc, char** argv) with argc and argv properly filled.</p>
